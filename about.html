                <p>
                    Hey, I'm Daniel. I am currently a 1st year student studying Computing at Munster Technological University. This website was created as part of my end of
                    semester Web Development module project. I created this project for two main reasons. The first, to satisfy the requirements for my end of year project. The
                    second, to share my experience with interrailing.
                    <br><br>
                    On the 31st of May 2024 I began my solo 3 week adventure through Europe, exploring the cities: London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, Munich, Paris, and Dublin, getting
                    to know the various cities and exploring the rich culture, language and of course the various activities each city had to offer.
                </p>

                        Over the course of three weeks, from May 31st to June 22nd, I travelled around to various European cities. 
                        <br><br>
                        Beginning the journey in London and ending the journey in Dublin, spending an average of three days in each country, I was fortunate to experience
                        a wide variety of cultures and languages.

            <p>
                Interrailing is an incredible experience and a unique way of travelling to multiple destinations in a certain duration of time, allowing you to visit
                multiple destinations as opposed to the traditional experience of visiting one place at a time.
                <br><br>
                Purchasing an Interrail pass from the Interrail website, it allows you to to travel to any country in Europe taking any train that supports the pass.
                Many different passes can be purchased from the website with various different lengths of time for travellers to choose from.

                <summary><b>How did you decide which countries to visit?</b></summary>
                <p>
                    A huge portion of my decision came from online, mainly TikTok. Researching the countries around Europe, I learned the most popular destinations and routes for 
                    backpackers. If you decide to book your own journey, I would recommend researching cities that offer what you are looking for i.e. culture, languages, art, arcitecture, ect.

                <summary><b>What travel apps do you recommend to use?</b></summary>
                <p>
                    I used a few apps throughout my travels. <br>For trains I used the Interrail app. <br> For accomodations, I booked through HostelWorld. <br>For
                    activities I recommend Tripadvisor / Wanderlog. <br><br> Last but not least, I recommend Google Maps, which was a life saver when navigating through
                    each city.
